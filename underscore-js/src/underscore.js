   * COLLECTIONS

   * In this section, we'll have a look at functions that operate on collections
   * of values; in JavaScript, a 'collection' is something that can contain a
   * number of values--either an array or an object.
   *
   *
   * IMPORTANT NOTE!
   * ===========
   *
   * The .first function is implemented for you, to help guide you toward success
   * in your work on the following functions. Whenever you see a portion of the
   * assignment pre-completed, be sure to read and understanding it fully before
   * you proceed. Skipping this step will lead to considerably more difficulty
   * implementing the sections you are responsible for.
